Malmö (/ˈmælmoʊ, ˈmɑːlmɜː/,[4][5][6] Swedish: [ˈmâlmøː] (listen); Danish: Malmø [ˈmælmˌøˀ]) is the largest city in the Swedish county (län) of Scania (Skåne). It is the third-largest city in Sweden, after Stockholm and Gothenburg, and the sixth-largest city in the Nordic region, with a population of 316,588 (municipal total 350,647 in 2021).[7] The Malmö Metropolitan Region is home to over 700,000 people,[8] and the Greater Copenhagen region, which includes Malmö as well as Copenhagen, is home to 4 million people.[9] Malmö is considered a gamma-level global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.
Malmö was one of the earliest and most industrialised towns in Scandinavia, but it struggled to adapt to post-industrialism. Since the 2000 completion of the Öresund Bridge, Malmö has undergone a major transformation, producing new architectural developments, supporting new biotech and IT companies, and attracting students through Malmö University and other higher education facilities. Over time, Malmö's demographics have changed and by the turn of the 2020s almost half the municipal population had a foreign background.[10] The city contains many historic buildings and parks, and is also a commercial centre for the western part of Skåne County. It is also home to Malmö FF, the Swedish football club with the most national championships and the only Nordic club to have reached the European Cup final.
